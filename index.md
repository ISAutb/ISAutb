### Basics of Pneumatics and Digital Image Processing workshop 2017

This workshop introduces pneumatics —  basic concepts, terminology, applications, and automation processes used throughout the pneumatics industry. Lessons cover a wide variety of pneumatic components, as well as provide a good grounding in basic pneumatic terminology.

The course covers:
1.	Basic Pneumatics
2.	Symbolic representation of devices and standards (ISO 1219) 
3.	Pneumatic circuits systems
4.	Design of circuit diagrams
5.	Practical exercises “hands on”

In addition, this workshop proceeds to address the mainstream areas of image processing. The major areas covered include image and video segmentation, intensity transformation, histogram operations, image thresholding and morphological image processing.  All the theoretical concepts have been explained in details. Then, their implementation is covered with OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), which occupies a position of eminence in both education and industrial applications.
